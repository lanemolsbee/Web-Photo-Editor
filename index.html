    <p id = "description"> This is a free photo editing service which allows
        you to edit pictures in many different ways. First, you must create a
        new canvas by clicking "Create Empty" (which creates a blank new canvas),
        or "Upload File," in which you will be prompted to select an image file to make
        adjustments to.
